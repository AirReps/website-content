1. The sliders represent a range of frequencies, which represent the audible spectrum that the human ear can hear (31Hz - 19kHz). You can see what these numbers translate to in the following screen:
    * **Freq (Hz):** the part of the audible spectrum you are modifying
    * **Gain:** Increase or decrease the volume of that frequency
    * **(dB):** The numerical value of the slider: -12dB to +12dB
    * **Q:** Represents the speaker's Q value. Generally speaking, the lower the value the better the speaker. **For our purposes, don't modify this value.**
    * ![Equaliser sliders](./assets/sound-quality/equaliser_sliders.jpg)
1. Common exmaples in each range:
    * **10-50Hz:** Low Frequency Effects (LFE). Barely audible and used by "bass shaker" devices.
    * **50-100Hz:** Musical bass - bass guitar, kick drums, orchestral bass, etc.
    * **100-200Hz:** Upper musical bass - lowest male volacs, "directional bass"
    * **200-4000Hz:** Midrange - Dialog, general instruments
    * **4000-20000Hz:** Treble - Cymbals, triangles, bells, etc (also sibilance - the "sssss" sound)
