:::caution
Flashing the incorrect firmware to your device could brick it;
only flash firmware if you're aware of this risk!
:::

## Tutorial
:::note
We recommend you download AirReps official application to flash firmware:
[AirReps156X](https://airreps.info/android)

If the above application does not work, we recommend trying
[this older version](https://airreps.info/androidapk) instead.
:::

Flashing your firmware is not an exact science, therefore your situation may be slightly different than
what you see in the video above.
