# Adding New Pages
New pages can be added, so long as they follow our naming and header conventions.

## Document naming convention
```shell
{{category}}-{{topic}}.md

Example:
guide-troubleshooting.md
```

### Document header convention
> All documents require this header!
```shell
---
id: {{category}}-{{topic}}
title: {{human-readable-titel}}
custom_edit_url: https://github.com/AirReps/website-content/blob/edit/{{document-name}}.md
---

Example:
---
id: guide-troubleshooting
title: Troubleshooting
custom_edit_url: https://github.com/AirReps/website-content/blob/edit/guide-troubleshooting.md
---
```

### Linking newly added pages (dev team only)
> Only members of our teamn can link new pages to our website logic.

Add the document's header `id` to [sideBars.js](https://github.com/AirReps/airreps-site/blob/development/sidebars.js) in our `airreps-site` repository. Merge when ready.




# Build & Deploy (dev team only)
