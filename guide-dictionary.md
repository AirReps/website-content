### **AirReps Dictionary**
###

Not sure what W2C means? What’s ANC? Don’t be confused, here’s a comprehensive dictionary explaining some of the lingo often used in the AirReps community.

**W2C**: *Where To Cop/Where To Buy*

[1] Often used when looking for the source or seller of a particular product. Essentially means, “Where can I buy this item?”

“ *Can you put the W2C for the V3.9’s in the subreddit?.*”

[2] Can also be used when providing where to buy a particular item.

“ *I’ll put the W2C in #clone-reviews tomorrow.*”

**Reps/Clones: Replicas**

[1] Product imitations with the intention of copying a particular product (in this case AirPod) as precisely as possible. This is not the same as a ‘knockoff’.

“ *Where can I get the best AirPod replicas?.*”

**Knockoffs**

[1] A spin-off or recreation of a product, but is noticeably not the same branding, as the brand it’s trying to “knock-off” (often to avoid counterfeit product charges/infringing intellectual property rights).

“*He got them Gucce shoes on.*”

**GP: Guinea Pig**

Guinea Pigging is kinda like being a test subject, but you're more dignified than that, so you’re like a pioneer! In this case, you will be the first to order a seller's item. This means you'll be the first to get pictures of their product and oftentimes you'll post them to be checked for quality by the community. This sometimes means you can take a W or an L in terms of the quality of the product, but regardless you’re helping to inform the community, and we appreciate it.

“ *Is anyone willing to GP Troy’s V4’s or Xiao Daniel’s Gen 2’s?.*”

**QC: Quality Control [PICS]**

[1] Quality Control (QC for short) PICS are pictures that are used to verify that a purchased product is of good quality.

“ *Can you send me the QC pics for HiCity v2.5’s?.*”

[2] In its proper meaning Quality Control refers to how sellers maintain standards in manufactured products by testing a sample of the output to ensure their products are functioning correctly.

“ *Vincent’s QC has gotten really poor recently. So many batches are defective!.*”

**LC: Legit Check**

Much like the name states, this refers to when someone wants to confirm that the product they just purchased is legitimate. This is often seen when someone buys AirPods, but not from a retailer (e.g. off a person-person second hand website, like eBay or Facebook Marketplace) and they want to be sure they're getting the real thing.  Hence, legit checks are a great way of finding out if an item you're purchasing is authentic or not.

“ *Can someone LC these AirPod Pro’s for me? Someone’s offering them on Facebook Marketplace for $130, which seems too good to be true.*”

**Agent: Freight agent/shipping forwarder**

An agent is a third-party who helps safely mitigate your purchase from the seller (often in China) to you. They act like a representative for the buyer and try to ensure that your product is not faulty or damaged, and that you get exactly what you think you’re buying.

“*You might need to use an agent to get them, as currently Hicity doesn’t ship to the Philippines.*”

“*The seller tried to trick me by sending i12’s but luckily my agent provided QC pics, and I was able to return it.*”

**Markings**

The text on the case and AirPods that provides general info about the AirPods, including the "Designed by Apple in California" text, model numbers & serial numbers with product info in the case.

**Transparency mode**

An ambient sound mode that uses a microphone to allow you to hear some environmental sounds while also listening to the audio from your AirPods Pro. This is particularly helpful in allowing in important, louder noises that you need to be conscious of, such as traffic or the boarding gate call at an airport.

“*I love transparency mode because I can focus in on the music from my AirPods and I can hear when the phone’s ringing.*”

**FAQ**

**A SIMILAR COMMUNITY HAS NEWER PRODUCTS?**  
The products listed above are the greatest of the greatest, we update it every day and make sure the product quality meets our standards before it makes it way onto the guide, similar communities might have lower standards and want to show that they have the newest products even though they might not have them at all. It could also be caused due to them using a different naming scheme than AirReps.

**WHICH ONE IS THE BEST?**  
The * one rep at the top of the list is the latest model, the other ones are previous models. Find one that fits your budget, ships to your country, has the features you need etc. Search for its reviews and make your own decision.

**WHAT VERSION IS THIS CLONE I FOUND?**  
There's no way to tell without using it - pictures and chip numbers that sellers tell you don't mean anything. Don't ask sellers things like "is this v2.5?", they won't understand. You can buy random ones if you want to take the risk. Otherwise, buy from the verified sellers above to know exactly which model you're getting

**HOW DO I CHECK WHAT CHIP I HAVE?**  
Download the Airoha Headset app and try to connect your AirPods to it. If they connect they are Airoha. You can also download the [AirReps 156X Airoha app] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airoha.utapp.sdk) on Android and try to connect your AirPods to the app. The app will tell you exactly what chipset is being used in your reps (only if they are Airoha). If they don't connect, then use this method:

Check the audio codec of your AirPods. To do this you need to use an Android 8.1 or Higher but lower than 10 device, or Mac.

- ANDROID METHOD https://airreps.info/androidcodeccheck
- MAC METHOD https://airreps.info/maccodeccheck

At the moment, it is hard to tell from the codec, as most chipsets now support AAC, but if it has SBC you can be sure the reps are using a lower end chipset.

**HOW DO I CHECK MY AIRPODS ARE REAL?**  
The quickest way is to connect them to an iPhone and go to Settings > General > About. There should be an "AirPods" section when you scroll down. If there is no AirPods section it's fake. If there is an AirPods section, make sure the Serial Number shown there matches the serial number on the inside of the AirPods lid - http://airreps.info/aboutsection However, some of the newest reps do have a working about page. In this case, for the Airpods Pro, you can check if Spatial Audio is working - make sure there is a noticeable difference in sound and that head tracking is working correctly. If the About page is there, for Airpods, you can check the firmware version in the About page - make sure it matches the latest AirPods firmware released by Apple.

If you can't do this before buying, make a post on the r/airreps subreddit or on the Discord and someone will help you

**IS i9999, SUPERPODS ETC. BETTER THAN SUPERCOPY OR THE LINKS IN THE GUIDE?**  
These names used to represent upgrades etc. Sadly, Chinese sellers saw this as an opportunity to make it look like they had the newer product while just selling the same product. Ignore all the numbers that sellers use, and marketing words like "superpods" - they don't mean anything anymore.




### **Ordering**
###

https://airreps.info/buyingdescription

**BUYING FROM ALIEXPRESS/ALIBABA**

* You can buy from Ali the same way as buying anything else online. It's safe and your card details are encrypted through AliPay. Just don't expect free returns, full refunds, or great customer service like Amazon. Even if the product is faulty, there is no 100% guarantee that you will receive a full refund.
*BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK*

* Always try to pay with a credit card or debit card that allows chargeback. This will be helpful if the seller doesn't agree to a refund.

* In the order details box put "No logo box, with text on the case, declare Gift and Value: $11 please" when ordering.

OR If you want the box with Apple logos, you can put "with Apple box" instead of "no logo box". BUT there is a higher chance of it being seized at customs, and you possibly won't get a refund. Personally, we don't recommend it since it's just the logo on the box, the AirPods inside are exactly the same, but if you really want it you can take the risk.

* After you buy, go to your order page and see what the name of your product is (e.g. Pro Airoha white). Click Contact Supplier to message the seller and confirm they're sending that one. Don't ask them things like "is this v2.5 with an Airoha chip?", they don't use these names. You can also ask about the "No logo box, with text on the case, declare Gift and Value: $11" to see if it's possible. NOTE: Some sellers may tell you they aren't able to do this.

IMPORTANT: By letting the sellers know that you’re from the AirReps community, they’re pressured to give you better service because of our standards. It also gives us better leverage for future buyers like you. For both you and us, please let them know that you’re from our AirReps community!

* In your Order page on Ali, there will be a shipping countdown that will auto-confirm delivery after a number of days. If the timer has 1 day left and you still haven't received them, make sure you click "Extend Shipping Time" to extend it 15 more days. Only click "Order Received" once you have them and have checked they work properly.

If you order from HiCity, you might want to consider buying through his official website (https://hicity.airreps.info/) instead as he cannot sell with apple markings on the airpods themselves on AliExpress. Note: There will be no corporation-backed buyer guarantee, but HiCity has shown us in the past that he’s trustworthy.


### **QC and LC**
Hey there, if you're reading this, then you probably either are looking to quality check (QC) your replica airpods, or you're looking to buy retails. In this segment of the guide, we will discuss how you can see the difference between retail airpods and replicas. We will start from the more simple methods and gradually go to the more advanced ones. PS: If the price seems too good, it probably is.

**First off, we will start with the simple ones to check design flaws.**  
* Check if the LED is diffused (frosted, or in other words has transparent (almost greyish) plastic inside instead of it being just a hole). If they have this, that is an extra point up to legit. This method works with all AirPods, 1st generation up to pro.

* Check if the hinge color looks right on the case, here are some reference pictures:  
AirPods wired case 1st/2nd gen:  
https://airreps.info/files/uploads/main-qimg-0e51e09bb85fb9763b1c33efd0539eec.jpg  
AirPods 2nd gen wireless case:  
https://airreps.info/files/uploads/48327858837_f924e7e4a1_o.jpg  
AirPods pro case:  
https://airreps.info/files/uploads/airpods-pro-vietnam-1590136750-3357-1590143827.jpg

* Check that the button on the case is flush with the rest of the case. If it isn’t, they are replicas, as the button should be flush with the case.

* We will not go over the text on them that includes certifications and serial/model numbers, as these vary heavily on what region they were sold in.


**We will now go over software differences.**  
* First off, we will start with the most obvious one, the popup. The popup should show up generally within 2-3 seconds (with Bluetooth on).

* Then, we will check if they have device settings on the “i” button by the bluetooth name in settings. This works for iOS 10 or higher with 1st generation and iOS 12.2 for the 2nd generation airpods. AirPods Pros have support from iOS 13.2 and higher.

* Now, we will check the “About Page”. Go into the settings app when having the pods connected, click on the “About” section. Scroll down, and see if there is a page called “AirPods” or “AirPods Pro” (There should be on retail). Now check that the serial number in that settings is the same as in the case.

* On AirPods Pro, you can check in the earlier mentioned airpods settings that there is a toggle called “Spatial Audio”  (iOS 14+, iPhone 7 or newer). If it exists, that gives extra points. Now try it out using the demo that Apple provides. It should sound like the audio is coming directly from the speakers of the phone when the feature is enabled, and you should be able to walk around the phone with the audio sounding like it's coming from the phone (when in reality no one else can hear it).


These are the main steps in LC/QC:ing airpods, if you feel like you need more help, please make sure to join the AirReps Discord server https://airreps.info/discord

**FAQ**

**WILL I GET A GOOD QUALITY UNIT?**  
Build quality, sound quality, reliability, is are always a gamble with reps. You could buy 2 of the same product from the same seller, and the quality could be completely different. There is no way to guarantee good quality, but the sellers above usually have good quality.

**HOW DO I CONTACT SELLERS?**  
Join the AirReps [Discord Server](https://airreps.link/discord) for all the seller's WhatsApp numbers since they are not publicized. You can also message them through Ali by clicking "Contact Supplier".

**MINIMUM ORDER IS MORE THAN ONE?**    
Click "Buy Sample" to buy just a single one or just contact the seller informing you need only one. They can create an order for you.

**I ORDERED x DAYS AGO AND IT HASN'T ARRIVED YET?**  
It can take a while to ship out from China. Tracking disappears when it leaves China and only updates once it reaches customs in your country. If it's been a long time and there still isn't even a tracking number, message your seller for an update.

*If your tracking info is in Chinese*, copy the tracking number and paste it into https://www.17track.net/, or open the tracking updates on a computer and paste them into Google Translate.

**MY CARD DOESN'T WORK?**  
Message the seller and ask if they'll take a different form of payment (beware that some alternative payment methods don't offer buyer protection e.g. Transferwise and Xoom). If not, try another card or a different seller. You can also try verifying your card through Apple Pay (if you have access to an iOS device), and purchasing through Apple Pay.

**SHIPPING COST IS TOO HIGH?**  
Message the seller and ask if they can offer cheaper shipping through ePacket etc, or see if they can ship it through an agent. If not, try a different seller.




### **Troubleshooting**

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

**COMMON ISSUES:**

**MACOS INCOMPATIBILITY**  
This issue is caused by iCloud verification failing, as the replicas do not support iCloud fully. The issue can be fixed by first forgetting the airpods on any iCloud device (iOS, iPadOS, WatchOS etc) you have connected to before.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

**AUDIO/VIDEO KEEPS PAUSING FREQUENTLY FOR NO REASON WHEN USING THE AIRPODS**  
This is very common on cheaper replicas, it is caused by the in ear detection sensors. This can also happen when the pods don't fit your ear fully. The fix is to either choose other eartips (on pros) or turn off in ear detection through settings.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

**AIRPODS STAY CONNECTED AFTER CLOSING THE CASE**  
This is an issue that is caused by the magnets inside the case and the hall sensor that checks in which position the magnetic field is, to fix this issue you will need to follow the steps in this youtube tutorial:  
https://youtu.be/kv5Ixw_YY2E

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

**SOUND QUALITY IS BAD / ISSUES WITH BASS ON iOS**  
This issue is caused by Headphone Accomodations being on by default. You will need to turn this off.  
Go to Settings > Accessibility > Audio / Visual > Headphone Accomodations and turn it off.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

**PAIRING RESET**   
This reset will help if only one pod is working, and it starts slowly flashing every time you open the case.
It is very simple.

* Hold the back pairing button for 2-3 seconds while the pods are in the case.

That's it. It's that simple.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

**SOFT RESET**

* Forget your device from Bluetooth settings, then turn off Bluetooth.

* Open the lid and hold the back button for a few seconds, until the light flashes, then close the lid. Don't worry if your light doesn't flash the same as in the image.

* Wait a full minute, then turn on Bluetooth, open the lid and try to reconnect

* If it doesn't work, take the pods out and put them back in. Close the lid and wait for the light to turn off. Then open it and try again. It can take 3-4 SOFT RESETS to work. If it doesn't try a HARD RESET

*Click on the link to view an image of how to soft reset*
https://airreps.info/softreset

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

**HARD RESET**

* Forget your device from Bluetooth settings

* Leave the pods outside of the case for several hours to let the battery fully drain. Leave the case open. It's important to not have any residual charge left, so leave it out one full day or more

* Once it's drained, put the pods back in the case and charge the case for a while

* Then, do a SOFT RESET. It can take 3-4 SOFT RESETS to work

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

**L/R IMBALANCE FIX (the easy way)**

Head to Settings > Accessibility on an iOS device.
Alternatively on an Android device:
In the Settings app, select Accessibility from the list.
On the Accessibility screen, scroll down to the Audio and On-Screen Text section.>
Here, you can adjust the left/right volume balance.
Move the slider until the audio seems to be calibrated right.


Next way is for advanced users, with basic soldering experience.
L/R IMBALANCE FIX (the hard way, but usually works better for stable bass and audio)  
If one of your AirPods is quieter or louder than the other you can try this community-written guide:
https://airreps.info/outofphase
Being "quieter" is not the correct description actually, they are out of phase. This happens when the people assembling the earbuds miswire one of them, resulting in an unpleasant sound and apparent lack of bass from one side. You can test your pair for phase alignment using this test.

**CAN'T CONNECT TO MACOS:**  
Forget the AirPods from your iPhone. (Seems to be an issue with iCloud Connect.)
Try to connect it now with your Mac.
(Optional) If you hear no sound playing from them when they’re connected, try to reset them.

**Audio doesn't play while Apple Watch is connected "WatchOS 7+ Issue"**

**THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN FIXED ON THE LATEST FIRMWARE/VERSION OF THE CLONES, UPDATE YOUR V3M/V4.5 IF YOU'RE EXPERIENCING THIS**

If you're running WatchOS you might experience issues with your AirPods clones like them not connecting or freezing up your phone, this can be fixed in two ways.  
*Credits to SykadeLick#4034 on discord for tracking down the issue.*  
**1.** Works for all types  
* Power off your Apple Watch/Put it in airplane mode  
* Your AirPods should now function correctly.

**2.** Only works for AirPods Pro clones
* With your AirPods Pro in your ears, go to Settings > Bluetooth on your iOS device.   
* Tap the info button next to your AirPods in the list of devices.  
* Tap Ear Tip Fit Test.  
* Tap Continue, then tap the Play button.  
* Your AirPods Pro should now function correctly.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  
*This should fix major issues.*

**NONE OF THESE FIXED IT?**    
Your AirPods probably arrived faulty, or they are broken beyond repair. You can keep trying SOFT RESETS and different HARD RESETS - e.g. leaving it out 1+ days, or not keeping the case open, or playing music instead of forgetting the device, and whatever other things that might drain the battery.

*If nothing at all works*, contact your seller and ask for a refund or replacement. If they don't agree, start a refund directly through Ali, that mostly works but if that doesn't work out consider doing a chargeback on your card.
