Not sure what W2C means? What’s ANC? Don’t be confused, 
here’s a comprehensive dictionary explaining some of the lingo often used in the 
AirReps community.

### W2C: Where To Cop/Where To Buy

[1] Often used when looking for the source or seller of a particular product. Essentially means, “Where can I buy this item?”

> “ *Can you put the W2C for the V3.9’s in the subreddit?.*”

[2] Can also be used when providing where to buy a particular item.

> “ *I’ll put the W2C in #clone-reviews tomorrow.*”

### Reps/Clones: Replicas

[1] Product imitations with the intention of copying a particular product (in this case AirPod) as precisely as possible. This is not the same as a ‘knockoff’.

> “ *Where can I get the best AirPod replicas?.*”

### Knockoffs

[1] A spin-off or recreation of a product, but is noticeably not the same branding, as the brand it’s trying to “knock-off” (often to avoid counterfeit product charges/infringing intellectual property rights).

> “*He got them Gucce shoes on.*”

### GP: Guinea Pig

Guinea Pigging is kinda like being a test subject, but you're more dignified than that, so you’re like a pioneer! In this case, you will be the first to order a seller's item. This means you'll be the first to get pictures of their product and oftentimes you'll post them to be checked for quality by the community. This sometimes means you can take a W or an L in terms of the quality of the product, but regardless you’re helping to inform the community, and we appreciate it.

> “ *Is anyone willing to GP Troy’s V4’s or Xiao Daniel’s Gen 2’s?.*”

### QC: Quality Control [PICS]

[1] Quality Control (QC for short) PICS are pictures that are used to verify that a purchased product is of good quality.

> “ *Can you send me the QC pics for HiCity v2.5’s?.*”

[2] In its proper meaning Quality Control refers to how sellers maintain standards in manufactured products by testing a sample of the output to ensure their products are functioning correctly.

> “ *Vincent’s QC has gotten really poor recently. So many batches are defective!.*”

### LC: Legit Check

Much like the name states, this refers to when someone wants to confirm that the product they just purchased is legitimate. This is often seen when someone buys AirPods, but not from a retailer (e.g. off a person-person second hand website, like eBay or Facebook Marketplace) and they want to be sure they're getting the real thing.  Hence, legit checks are a great way of finding out if an item you're purchasing is authentic or not.

> “ *Can someone LC these AirPod Pro’s for me? Someone’s offering them on Facebook Marketplace for $130, which seems too good to be true.*”

### Agent: Freight agent/shipping forwarder

An agent is a third-party who helps safely mitigate your purchase from the seller (often in China) to you. They act like a representative for the buyer and try to ensure that your product is not faulty or damaged, and that you get exactly what you think you’re buying.

> “*You might need to use an agent to get them, as currently Hicity doesn’t ship to the Philippines.*”
> “*The seller tried to trick me by sending i12’s but luckily my agent provided QC pics, and I was able to return it.*”

### Markings

The text on the case and AirPods that provides general info about the AirPods, including the "Designed by Apple in California" text, model numbers & serial numbers with product info in the case.

### Transparency mode

An ambient sound mode that uses a microphone to allow you to hear some environmental sounds while also listening to the audio from your AirPods Pro. This is particularly helpful in allowing in important, louder noises that you need to be conscious of, such as traffic or the boarding gate call at an airport.

> “*I love transparency mode because I can focus in on the music from my AirPods and I can hear when the phone’s ringing.*”
